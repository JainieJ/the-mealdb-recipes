Check out this project at https://themealdb-react-proj.netlify.com/

This is the first project I did after learning the basics of **React**.

In this project I practiced class and functional componentes, lifecycle methods, learnt
the tricks of asynchronous setState, the basics of breaking app into components. I also learnt the basics of **React Router** (Switch, Route, Link).

The project uses data from **MealDB API**, so I also had to figure out how to work with **AJAX requests** in React and the basics of setting up **environmental variables**.

In general, it was a good project to beging with, though rather simple in terms of no state management, as it implements the so-called **props drilling**.
